GnitPick was in a pre-alpha state of development when development was stopped.  The tool ran until Jython was updated to 2.x, but was never complete or stable.

GnitPick was more of a desktop toy to explore how a scripting language running on top of the JVM could glue together a GUI app with strong access to Java libraries, and serve as the basis for a RAD/4GL-like development toolkit. 

Consider the code I've written for GnitPick to be released into the public domain.  Each of the libraries used has its own license which applies to its components.
