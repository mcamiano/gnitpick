         <um>Good help is so hard to come by these days.</um>
         <um>The GUI is so intuitive we didn't think help was necessary.</um>
         <um>It's all in your head. You don't really need help.</um>
         <um>Keep trying.</um>
         <um>I guess the honeymoon is over...</um>
         <um>I feel just awful. Is there something wrong?</um>
         <um>Pay me a dollar.</um>
         <um>Just don't give up.</um>
         <um>You're FIRED  -  No, just kidding. You're still stuck here.</um>
         <um>Don't ask too many questions or someone might notice you don't know the answers.</um>
         <um>Punt. It works for the rest of the programming team.</um>
         <um>Did you really expect help?</um>
         <um>I'm too tired to help.</um>
         <um>Use Google.</um>
         <um>Pay Mitch to help.</um>
         <um>Aren't you too proud to ask for help?</um>
         <um>Please not right now, I have a headache.</um>
         <um>You didn't ask nicely enough. Wait 10 minutes and ask again more politely.</um>
         <um>You didn't say 'Please'.</um>
         <um>I don't feel like helping. I'm having a bad day.</um>
         <um>Exception in thread \"AWT-EventQueue-0\" Traceback (innermost last): You should have paid Mitch.</um>
         <um>Must be a serious problem. Wait right here!</um>
         <um>Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back...</um>
         <um>I'll have to get back to you on that.</um>

         <um>Why do you keep asking for help???</um>
         <um>AARRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH!!!!!</um>

         <um>Seriously, if you need help that badly you should seek some professional assistance.</um>
         <um>Read the FAQ. Wait - there is no FAQ.</um>
         <um>Just keep trying. You'll get it eventually.</um>
         <um>Why not just hit the computer? That usually makes me feel better.</um>
         <um>It's too late for you.</um>
         <um>Go back to school.</um>
         <um>I don't want to right now - I'm watching my T.V. show.</um>
